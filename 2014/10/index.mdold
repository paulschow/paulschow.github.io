Just in time for Halloween, I modified my previous [Raspberry Pi Internet LED Control](http://www.paulschow.com/2013/06/raspberry-pi-internet-led-control.html) project to control an RGB LED, and stuck it inside a fake pumpkin. Now I have an internet controlled RGB pumpkin!  
  
  
  
  
[The code](http://github.com/paulschow/WebLedPi) is basically the same as the old [Raspberry Pi Internet LED Control](http://www.paulschow.com/2013/06/raspberry-pi-internet-led-control.html), but instead of using four links to turn four LEDs on or off, it uses a form to control the levels of the three legs of the RGB LED.  
  
I used a [common anode diffused RGB LED](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10821) for this, which I received from the [Sparkfun dumpster dive](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12012) a few months ago.  
  
I wired it up to the extra pins on the Rpi V2, BCM numbers 28, 29, and 30. The resistors are each 100 Ohm. Some wiring guides for RGB LEDs have a 180 Ohm for the red, and 100 for blue and green. I used what I had, which was 100. It works fine for me.

After trying out a few test programs, I was ready to make it interface with the web. At first, I started with my old code and was modifying it to take any url operator (?color=ff00ff), but then I found the [WebPy form library](http://webpy.org/form). This is a much more elegant solution, although an even better one would use something like Ajax to enable live updates.

At first, I had it so that 100 was full off and 0 was full on. I later changed this to be compatible with [color pickers](http://www.colorpicker.com/) that give RGB values from off at 0 to full on at 255.

Here's a video of the initial test:  

  
  
The color of the LED is pretty hard to pick out, because it needs a diffuser. A popular thing to use is a ping pong ball with a hole in it. Instead, I used a fake pumpkin.

This pumpkin used to have an incandescent lightbulb in the back. I took that out and just placed the LED inside.

This works very well. The inside of the pumpkin is matte white, so it shows the correct color.

Here's a video of the final product:  

  
I'm pretty happy with it. The plan is to put it on a table for a Halloween party and give out the address, which should prove entertaining for five minutes.

### Update:

  
I added [phant.py from python-phant](https://github.com/matze/python-phant) to this, so now it outputs to [data.sparkfun.com](http://data.sparkfun.com/).

 I also adapted their [tutorial on using google charts](http://phant.io/graphing/google/2014/07/07/graphing-data/) to make a html file with a graph of  the values.

Heh, just needs some animatronics to move the "beam" around inside.
